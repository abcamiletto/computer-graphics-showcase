					<h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Our submission for the rendering competition of the WS23/24 iteration of Computer Graphics I
                        at Saarland University is called "Frontière Rouge". It was assembled in Blender and rendered
                        in our fork of the Lightwave renderer called <b>Haytham</b>, named after the medieval Arab father
                        of modern optics, Ibn al-Haytham.
                        <br /><br />
                        This year's competition theme is <b>Journey to the Unknown</b>. For a human to step 
                        onto Mars is one of the great shared ambitions of our time. The red planet has been a source of wonder
                        for centuries, and year by year, we come closer to reaching our mysterious neighbor.
                        The journey to Mars is a journey to the unknown not only because of the largely unexplored environment
                        of the planet but also because of the scientific and engineering challenges that come with the journey itself.
                        It is thus a journey not only in terms of distance but also in terms of knowledge gained along the path of its realization.
                        <br /><br />
                        For us, the realization of this rendering competition was a journey through the unknown. Along the way, we learned a lot
                        about physically based rendering, the challenges of implementing a renderer, and the many ways in which we can use Blender to
                        create beautiful and realistic scenes. Memorable journeys are seldom without difficulties but always full of special
                        moments; in this regard, our journey was no exception.
                        <br /><br />
                        Thus, in the following section, we will present the features of our renderer and the challenges we faced along the way.    
						<br /><br />
					</p>
					<h2>Features & Challenges</h2>
					<p>Some of you who read this might also be on a journey to implement your own renderer, either here at
						Saarland University or elsewhere. We would like to share some of the challenges we faced along the way, so that you
						might be better prepared for your own journey. These challenges are best illustrated by the features we implemented in our renderer
						that went mostly beyond the scope of the course. We hope that you will find our experiences helpful and appreciate the 
						visual results we achieved with our renderer.

				<div class="content">
					<h2>Thin Lens Camera</h2>
					<p>The thin lens camera is one of the simplest camera models. In contrast to the pinhole model it is already able to simulate
						depth of field effects, which can add a good amount of realism to a scene.
						<br /><br />
						One of the challenges with camera models is that to make them even more realistic seems to require an exponential amount of effort.
						We tried to implement the realistic camera model from <a href=https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Camera_Models/Realistic_Cameras>PBRT</a>,
					    but we had to give up on it because of the time constraints of the course.
						We think that the thin lens camera is a good compromise between realism and effort.

				<div class="content">
					<h2>Area Lights</h2>
					<p>Area lights are a way to use shapes as light sources, which can bring benefits in terms of more realistic shadows
					   and noise reduction. The sun you see reflected on the helmet of the astronaut is a spherical area light.
					   <br /><br />
					   Our naive implementation of spherical area lights consisted of sampling random points on the sphere, which 
					   resulted in a lot of noise, as half of the samples are usually on the non visible hemisphere. 
					   We then implemented cosine hemisphere based importance sampling, which improved the quality of the images by a lot.

				<div class="image"><img src="images/bunny_halton.jpg" alt=""
						data-hover-image="images/bunny_independent.jpg" /></div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>Halton Sampler</h2>
					<p>In order to reduce noise in Monte-Carlo methods on which realistic rendering algorithms are based one can improve upon random sampling
					   by using low discrepancy sequences i.e sequences that look very uniformly distributed. Of these sequences, the Halton sequence is one of the most
					   popular. If you want to see for yourself how much better it is than random sampling, you can play around with 
					   <a href=https://github.com/Thunfischpirat/JuliaPlayground/blob/main/Inference/MonteCarlo.jl>this</a> simulation made by one of the authors using Julia.
					   <br /><br />
					   One issue with low discrepancy sequences is that they are not independent, which can lead to aliasing artifacts in the image. By adding random offsets to the sequence 
					   generated for each pixel we were able to reduce these artifacts to the point where they are not percievable anymore.

				<div class="image"><img src="images/bunny_spheres.jpg" alt=""
						data-hover-image="images/bunny_spheres_denoised.jpg" /></div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>Image Denoising</h2>
					<p>Using Intel's Open Image Denoise library, which is based on Deep Learning and uses different aspects of the scene 
					   such as the albedos and normals to denoise a rendered image we were able to basically get rid of all noise in our final rendering
					   this is especially helpful due to the quadratic relationship between quality of the rendering and the number of samples that need
					   to be used.
					   <br /><br />
					   While the library itself is easily integrated into Lightwave there are some pitfalls when it comes to installing it properly.
					   In our case the library was not added to the PATH variable, which caused the renderer to crash when trying to use it.

				<div class="content">
					<h2>Tone Mapping</h2>
					<p>Some scenes are taken under cirumstances where the dynamic range of the scene is much higher than the dynamic range of the display
					   that is used to view the scene. In order to make the scene viewable on a display the dynamic range of the scene has to be compressed.
					   This process is called tone mapping. We implemented the Reinhard tone mapping operator, which is a simple and fast tone mapping operator
					   that is based on the logarithm of the pixel values.
					   <br /><br />
					   Although the implementation of the tone mapping operator itself was not very difficult, adapting the scene to make it benefit
					   from the tone mapping turned out to make the scene not look good w.r.t realism. Thus in the end we decided to not use it.

				<div class="content">
					<h2>Add & Mix Materials</h2>
					<p>Many materials, scenery and objects are readily available in Blender, the tool we used to create our scene. 
					   Unfortunately, the Lightwave renderer does not support all of the materials like the common AddShader and MixShader. <br />
					   Although in many cases it is possible to work around this issue by rephrasing everything in a Principled BSDF material,
					   the results is never exactly as the artist intended.
					   <br /><br />
					   The main issue in doing this is the lack of documentation on the exporter plugin: there is no mention that the alpha channel
					   of the image texture is not exported, and the typing hints are only available here and there.
